## Overview
This project presents a **slice-aware energy optimization** framework for 5G networks using **simplicial homology**. By modeling the network as a **simplicial complex**, it identifies redundant coverage and optimizes **base station power levels** to **reduce energy consumption** while maintaining Quality of Service (QoS) for different 5G slices:
- **eMBB (Enhanced Mobile Broadband)**
- **URLLC (Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications)**
- **mMTC (Massive Machine-Type Communications)**

MATLAB simulations demonstrate up to **65% energy savings**, and AI-based techniques are integrated for **real-time network adjustments**.
